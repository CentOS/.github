# Sagano

For many years, we've had Linux and containers operating in connected but
separate worlds.  Today, we are excited to announce that we are bringing these
worlds together.  We're making the ecosystem of content available to you in
containers, now to your core Linux systems.  Containers now become the language
for building the OS.  Boot them to your core Linux systems.  Modify them in a
Containerfile/Dockerfile.  Whether standalone images to modify as you see fit in
your datacenter, immutable images at the edge or worker nodes in
Kubernetes/OpenShift - one, consistent approach.  We're always striving to make
developing applications across the hybrid cloud easier and to make your IT
landscape easier to manage even as you face increasing complexity.  And we hope
you are as excited about this as we are.
